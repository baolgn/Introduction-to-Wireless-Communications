# Introduction to Wireless Communication

This repository contains my work from the *Introduction to Wireless Communications* course. Although this is a graduate-level course, I am currently following it to deepen my understanding of wireless communication systems and to enhance my skills in implementing solutions using **MATLAB**. The projects and exercises in this repository focus on key concepts in wireless technologies and signal processing.
